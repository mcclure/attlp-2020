# Andi Tries to Learn Prolog?

**An experiment**

I'm going to try to do a stream (or series of streams?) where I learn to use antique logic-programming language Prolog, and maybe then attempt some more modern logic systems like Kanren, and explain it for viewers as I go. I am going to archive stream materials here.

### The stream

Watch at [https://www.twitch.tv/mcc111](https://www.twitch.tv/mcc111) at 2 PM ET, Jul 18. This time I'm gonna try to write a Sudoku solver.

#### Previous streams

* [Stream 1, Jul 11](https://www.twitch.tv/videos/676700202): In which we learned the Prolog basics, and accidentally recreated Peano arithmetic from scratch.

### Links to follow along with the stream

You can run examples with this without installing anything:

* [Run Prolog in a web browser](https://swish.swi-prolog.org/)

I'm going to read some of this before the stream:

* ["Learn Prolog Now"!](http://lpn.swi-prolog.org/lpnpage.php?pageid=online)

This is the book I'm going to try (?) to follow along with during the stream:

* [Read "The Art of Prolog" online](https://mitpress.mit.edu/books/art-prolog-second-edition) (click "Open Access")

#### Sudoku

* [Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hAyZ9K2EBF0) is the sudoku I'm gonna try to solve on the Jul 18 stream.

### After the stream...

There is a [workshop on Kanren](https://icfp20.sigplan.org/home/minikanren-2020) happening in August 2020.
